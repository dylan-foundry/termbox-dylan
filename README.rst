This library wraps `termbox`_.

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed.

This assumes that you've already got `termbox`_ installed
and on the default search path.

You will need Open Dylan 2013.2 or later.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
`melange`_ repo on your ``$PATH``.

.. _melange: https://github.com/dylan-lang/melange
